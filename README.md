I am a PhD student in Psychology at Université de Montréal under the guidance of Prof. Shahab Bakhtiari. My research is at intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, particularly focusing on modelling the visual system. I use artificial neural networks trained with self-supervised learning to simulate and understand the complexities of the visual system.
